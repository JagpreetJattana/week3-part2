                TV is on and you came to know that city is infected with a deadly virus.
                 Most of the people are infected by virus. That virus infects biological structure of human beings and makes them zombies. 
                Government have established a “Safety Camp” somewhere in city and has asked every survivor to be there on their own. Your task is to reach that safety camp.
Now you explore the room and found two buttons on the wall. Red and white.
Which one you will press.
